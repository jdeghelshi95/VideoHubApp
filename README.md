### This is a Video Embedding app that stores your embeds to your unique user account from several different websites. 

## Technologies:
- Express
- Mongoose
- Dcrypt
- Passport - Local method
- Heroku
- Bootstrap 
- CSS
- Javascript
- MongoDB


### App Description 
WIll be making a page where users can store embeded urls of video they liked to see all their favorite videos in one place. 
WIll also allow for editing of video links and descriptions saved to replace ones they no longer like or add additional videos. 
App will also have the ability to delete videos that are no longer needed. All in all the main point of the app is to make it easier to watch videos that you don't want to lose track of all in one place.  




### MVP

- have user and password work seamlessly and be able to store all of users saved videos.
- have all videos work seamlessly in the browser without the need to open a new tab, by having player be embedded into page itself. 
- have all features such as add, edit and delete work seamlessly. 


### User stories

- User enters url for app
- user log's in with credentials or creates an account
- user is shown main page and can add content with add button in center
- user can edit added videos by modifying urls/description
- user can delete videos with the x on top right of video player



### Stretch Goals

- would also like for app to pause/mute audio from video if another one is selected. 

- would like for there to be different tabs/pages of categories if user chooses to have several different categories. 
- would like to add analytics of each video by the player to make experiance more seemless
